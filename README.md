# Z-Transform Explorer

## Overview
Z-Transform Explorer is an interactive web-based tool designed to help students and engineers understand the Z-transform and its applications in digital signal processing and control systems. The project provides a hands-on approach to exploring the transformation of discrete-time signals into a complex frequency-domain representation.

## Features
- **Interactive Signal Generator**: Generate and visualize discrete-time signals with adjustable frequency and amplitude.
- **Z-Transform Computation**: Convert signals into their Z-transform representation.
- **Linear Difference Equation Solver**: Analyze and solve difference equations using Z-transform techniques.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: View input and output signals dynamically as parameters change.
- **Educational Content**: Learn about key concepts such as system stability, transfer functions, and digital filters.

## Mathematical Foundation
The Z-transform of a discrete-time signal \(x[n]\) is given by:

\[ X(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]z^{-n} \]

This transformation simplifies the analysis of discrete-time systems by converting difference equations into algebraic equations.

### Difference Equation Representation
The system follows the equation:

\[ y[n] + a_1 y[n-1] + a_2 y[n-2] = b_0 x[n] + b_1 x[n-1] \]

where:
- \( a_1, a_2 \) are system coefficients
- \( b_0, b_1 \) are input coefficients
- \( x[n] \) is the input signal
- \( y[n] \) is the output signal

## Applications
- **Digital Filters**: Design and analysis of digital filtering systems.
- **Control Systems**: Stability analysis and controller design.
- **Signal Processing**: Analysis and transformation of discrete-time signals.
